            <p>Hi there, my name is Shivesh and I'm a Pune based multidisciplinary designer currently working at Scroll Media. Formerly I was the UI/UX Designer at Ongraph. With an interest in exploring the infinite, my work is led by balancing purpose and impact while using a blend of design and invention across every digital medium available.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about a lot of things, but specifically, Games, travel, and doing good in the world. I aim to build a bridge that may remove the gap between the rich and the poor and to support those who are not as fortunate. The world can always use more love.</p>
            <p>Working in a multidisciplinary group that includes experience design and research, content strategy and design operations to impact everything a user will interact with â€“ this includes internal users like our customer agents, Designing for trust and designing for everyone. It's a real advantage to have so many disciplines as you're constantly exposed to many different facets of the work. Some of the things I care or do in my daily life to make products better :</p>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Making sure everyone feels like they belong on a product is in part the responsibility of the user experience design.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Set out to build a design language system (DLS) with some specific goals: create a common language that is understood across disciplines, establish an iconic visual language, and define components that make designing and building product easier.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Understanding the flexibility of the design with the tech team before going through any designing any product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I'm a big fan of Slack and its integrations. It's really easy to share files and feedback. My team uses it pretty much constantly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I'm dedicated to building and integrating tools; everything from asset integration into Sketch to prototyping environments. Having access to everything quickly is crucial, whether it's an icon or a piece of research.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>I've designed and shipped multiple apps and gone through multiple release cycles on a larger project.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
