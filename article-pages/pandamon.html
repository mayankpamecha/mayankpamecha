            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Pandamon’s core objective is to ​save pandas and help the species grow</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Help Panda Conservation Centres and their researchers understand the behavior & needs of pandas</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The app that can be used by researchers to visualize and monitor the data collected through the pandamon band.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Keeping an eye on the pandas in the center and making sure they are healthy and active.</p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <p>Making a To-Do list in the app to help researchers manage tasks and take personal care of cubs and injured pandas. Feed them regularly, help them walk...</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Take monthly health measurement of pandas to keep track of their growth: height, weight, and  photographs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When multiple pandas need personal care, it’s difficult to divide the work among researchers, as pandas move around the center and their location changes every day. In this case, call other  researchers for help.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Assumptions / Questions</h3>
            <p><b>Question:</b> What happens if the device ran out of battery?</p>
            <p><b>Assumption:</b> I'm assuming that the battery can be changed anytime. While the device is turned off during the battery change process it is easy to turn on the device(No setup process required).</p>
            <p><b>Question: </b> What amount of technical knowledge do the researchers have? In case of a major technical problem, do they need to call the pandamon technical team for help?</p>
            <p><b>Assumption: </b> For the assignment, I'm simply assuming that the device does not break down(to keep the scope of the task limited). If they do need help they can simply call the team.</p>
            <p><b>Assumption: </b> All the pandamon bands, panda profiles, conservation center's account and researchers account are setup bu the pandamon team. All these flows and screens are not a part of the solution.</p>
            <p><b>Assumption: </b> If the researcher is not well due to some reasons they can call for help and someone from the other center will be there to cover his place.</p>
            <p><b>Assumption: </b> A researcher can check all the pandas status in the app (map/list view) with the help of a unique ID.</p>
            <h3>Key problems</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>The data collected through the band should be easily understandable.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Track the growth</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Filter the activities to get the job done faster.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Call for help in a case where multiple pandas are sick or require personal case.</p>

                <h3>The Start</h3>
                <p>Before starting down the design and everything I went to the research phase Where I tried to find some inspirations.</p>
                <p>Once the research is done I wrote down the core objective, assumptions and key problems for the assignment.</p>
                <p>Once I have the base objective for the app ready I worked on the use cases for the solution. Below is the brief LO-FI of the solution -</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <h3>The Use Case</h3>
                <p>All the pandamon bands, panda profiles, conservation center's account and, researchers account are set up by the pandamon team. All these flows and screens are not a part of the solution.</p><br>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/use-case.png" alt="wireframe">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>My main focus for the assignment is the dashboard. The dashboard is the first thing when you log in to the app or signup for the first time.</p>
                <p>The dashboard consists of 6 entities: Activity, Notifications, search, To-Do, Profile setting, and filters.</p>
                <h3>The Wireframe</h3>
                <p>To have a better understanding of the Lo-Fi, I moved them to Hi-Fi wireframe.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/wireframe.png" alt="wireframe">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>The dashboard is mainly divided into 2 sections - List view and map view. Both of these views can we switched easily with the help of a toggle button.</p>
                <h4>Detailed exploration: Dashboard</h4>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-map-view.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>The Researchers can click on location indicator (this might change from location pin icon to a panda icon in visual design) to jump into that panda profile. </p>
                <p>Each location indicator is followed by a health bar. Which will visually tell the user if any panda is critical? The bar will also alert in case of low battery.</p>
                <p>You can easily switch to list view by clicking on the top right corner.</p>
                <p>All these activities can be further filtered to easily see the critical status, female pandas, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-list-view.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>In the list view, you can explore the pandas by their pictures followed by their ID</p>
                <p>You can click on the panda profile to jump into the detailed panda profile. Where you can see all the data for that specific panda.</p>
                <p>The dashboard Refreshes automatically when you open the app or go to the dashboard tab.</p>
                <p>Dashboard has 5 short menus at the bottom - Dashboard, Notifications, Search, Tasks(To-Do) and profile section(Researcher).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <h4>Detailed Exploration: Filters</h4>
                <p>You will land on this screen when you click on the filter icon at the top of the dashboard.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-filter-page.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>Filters have a design of an accordion so you can easily see all the options (Accordion title) followed by the sub-options (Accordion body)</p>
                <p>The Accordion body consists of checkboxes.</p>
                <p>To apply changes you have to click on the apply changes button at the top. In the same way, if you want to discard the filters you have to click on the discard changes button at the top.</p>
                <p>Filters make it easy to manage the task i.e. If the researcher wants to check the reports/activities of pregnant pandas he can simply select that option from the filter. This will show him all the pregnant pandas in his area.</p>
                <h4>Detailed Exploration: Notifications</h4>
                <p>Notifications will have the same design of the dashboard list view for showing notifications.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-notifications.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>The notifications might carry information from the to-do, critical activity, updates, etc. It will not contain the activity feed.</p>
                <p>A researcher can easily sort the notifications by clicking on the tab links. Will will consist - All notifications and critical notifications.</p>
                <h4>Detailed Exploration: Search</h4>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-search.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>A researcher can search about the pandas with the help of keywords or he can use the tags/segments just after the search input. Every time the researcher searches something he will be shown different tags for an elastic search. So the researcher can get the results he was looking for instead of some random related results.</p>
                <h4>Detailed Exploration: Tasks(To-Do)</h4>
                <p>Added this section into the app so that the researcher can manage his tasks here. By adding new, Editing the status of a task, and deleting a task. This section will help the researcher whenever any cub needs a personal case. A researcher can make tasks(Feeding at 2 pm every day, walking, etc) on a daily basis to make sure the cubs are getting daily/weekly care.</p>
                <p>Set a timer for a monthly checkup of the pandas. In this way, he will get an in-app notification in the notification section.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-todo.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>Set a timer for a monthly checkup of the pandas. In this way, he will get an in-app notification in the notification section.</p>
                <h4>Detailed Exploration: Panda profile</h4>
                <p>Panda profile will tell a deep exploration of various activities (Health, Sleeping, Eating, walking, etc.)</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-panda-profile.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>Researchers can check the band battery, Panda general information in this section. Also, the activities can be filtered according to the timestamp and they type of activity.</p>
                <p>Checkups and other important information related to panda will be available in pandas profile.</p>
                <h4>Detailed Exploration: Activity Detailed view</h4>
                <p>This page appears when a researcher taps on the activity for further details.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/pandamon/brief-activity-details.png" alt="map-view">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>A bar graph is created according to the panda activities and further a brief is displayed just below that for a better understanding.</p>
                <p>The idea behind creating this page is to help the researcher solve a critical/normal activity by proving a brief solution for this kind of problem.</p>
                <p>Also, the researcher can call out for help if a problem might get out of control (Doctor/other researchers).</p>
                <h3>Visual Design</h3>
                <p>Keeping the visual design clean and easy to understand. Made 3 iterations of Dashboard list view - one with the toggle, one with a compass icon to jump on the map view and the last one with the badge.</p>
                <p>The badge indicates the number of updates a panda have that is not seen.</p><br>
