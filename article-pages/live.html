        <div class="project-body lg-6 md-8 sm-12">
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>- Indicating that an article is currently live on homepage and article page (any slot)</p>
            <p>- Indicating that a new block has been added/updated at least when the reader is on the same article (when the reader is in the middle or at the bottom of the live article)</p>
            <h3>How we solved</h3>
            <p>We were working in a small group of people which involves product manager, developers and designers but the problem was big as how are we going to launch a feature that catches the eyes of reader and let him understand that a article is running live.</p>
            <p>Also how are we going to show the live updates in a article ? We came across multiple iterations to make things happen and it was a success.</p>
            <p>Before anything starts we need to think of something that we can add at various slots of the homepage / article page. Here are some of the blocks we've designed to check and put on different slots and check which one works perfect-</p>
            <img src="../img/project-images/live/live-indicators.jpg" alt="live Indicators">
            <span class="image-footer">Live indicator iterations</span>
            <p>We now put few of them on them on the article and homepage to see which one works perfectly without breaking the slots where they are inserted.</p>
            <p>Iterations -</p>
            <img src="../img/project-images/live/homepage1.png" alt="homepage">
            <span class="image-footer">Live indicator on various slots of homepage</span><br><br>

            <span class="image-footer">Article page</span><br><br>

            <img src="../img/project-images/live/article3.png" alt="article"><br><br>
            <h4>Final Cut -</h4>
            <p>While working on the final iteration we choose the live indicator with the dot and text live. But there was still something missing so we created a blinker animation on the dot.</p>
