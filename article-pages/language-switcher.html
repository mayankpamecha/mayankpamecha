            <p>Scroll is currently available in 2 versions - English and hindi. We needed something to let our readers know that we are available in different editions/languages. To Solve this we moved through a couple of iterations trying to figure the possible methods.</p>

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <p>During the product cycle we've gone through multiple iterations to provide the best experience for the readers that's easy and quick.</p>
            <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/iteration1.jpg" alt="iteration1">
            <span class="image-footer">Iteration 1 - Putting the language switcher in kabab menu</span>
            <p>The first thought was to put the language switcher in the kabab menu which appears when a reader click on the right menu on the top right corner</p>
            <p>By using the accordion functionality we can easily open and close. Also the space can be easily managed. </p>
            <p>The was a bit complex for the regular readers as they might skip this feature. We then decided to show language feature on the homepage itself so that the user can easily notice the changes on the site.</p>
            <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/iteration2.jpg" alt="iteration2">
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/iteration2d.jpg" alt="iteration2">
            <span class="image-footer">Iteration 2 - Putting the language switcher dropdown next to scroll logo</span>
            <p>Putting the language switcher next to scroll logo was a cleaner solution but this might affect the branding and for the desktops it might take the space of the date and time. So we decided to come up with something else.</p>
            <h4>Iteration 3</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/iteration3.jpg" alt="iteration1">
            <span class="image-footer">Iteration 3 - Seperate section before the menu and branding</span>
            <p>That's also a simple solution that one could thought of. Creating a seperate section for the language section before anything starts. It can all sopport multiple languages support along with the dark land light mode support for the readers.</p>
            <h4>Iteration 4</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/iteration4.png" alt="iteration1" class="mobile-view-image">
            <span class="image-footer">Iteration 4 - Redesigning the whole menu</span>
            <p>Redesigning the whole menu. This might work as most of the people are doing it now a days by creating a botton navigation along with the top navigation. With the amount of bandwidth we had this option might not work for now but for future when we are completely redesigning the menu. We can then think of it.</p>
            <h4>Final Iteration</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/final.png" alt="iteration1" class="mobile-view-image">
            <span class="image-footer">Final iteration - A custom made icon</span>
            <p>The final thought was to use a custom made icon that might change the languages with just one click. The reason behind this is - we are currently available in 2 editions so a single icon might work for now. We can change this completely whenever we are redesiging the full navigation. For the small devices (320px) we pushed the search option into the kabab menu as there is no breating space for 5 icons at the top menu.</p>
            <img src="../img/project-images/language-switcher/project-hero.jpg" alt="project-hero">
            <p>Hindi and English alphabets changes as we switch editions.</p>
