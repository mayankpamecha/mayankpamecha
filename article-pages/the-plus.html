        <div class="project-body lg-6 md-8 sm-12">
            <p>The Plus is an exclusive section for subscribers. It features an exciting mix of hand-picked experiences, invites, and offers.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>A place for Subscribers to get in on exclusive deals and benefits</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Can’t look like cheap or impersonal coupon/deal websites</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Needs to have a hand-crafted feel for every deal</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Partners need to be able to tell a story in deals, percentage-off not the key element like other coupon websites</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Needs to be different in UX and visual design of Bookshop</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Should be dynamic in the sense that changes since last visit and/or fresh data is easily highlighted for subscribers</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Should be distinct and premium enough that more partners would be encouraged to sign up</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Partners</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Taj Innercircle, Blue Tokai, Teabox, Crossword, Penguin Random House</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Highlight Partner logos and/or names in deals</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Allow partners to tell a story rather than impersonal and by-the-numbers deals</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Product User Experience and Design</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Make sure there is a hand-crafted and premium feel to UX</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Allow partners to tell a story</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create various media cards to aid partners in telling a story; Card with Image, Card with Video, Card with no image or video, Card with Image Carousel, Card with feature/benefit checklist, Card with book, Etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don’t be scared to go outside of Scroll visual language a bit. The key is that the UX Scroll is known for should be maintained</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Masonry layout (Pinterest-style) aids in hand-crafted feel. Helps avoid users’ eyes glazing over content. Also helps in giving maximum space for partners to tell story, makes different card types possible and makes design feel less dull/boring.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Touchpoints</h3>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>A deal card with good hierarchy of information on both the deal homepage and article page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A deal homepage with collection of such cards - Logged-out/Non-subscriber view of homepage with a prompt to inform readers on what they are missing out on by not subscribing - Scroll+ branding to drive home the exclusive nature of this product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A new article type to - at a glance inform subscribers that this is different than other articles and to create stronger hierarchy for the story around deal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A claim button that allows subscribers to view coupon code, takes them to a unique link, show them a message that we'll email them on how to claim the deal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A new Scroll+ icon in the masthead/navigation that houses subscriber-only links.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <p>This product took a series of iteration as the challenge was to make something looks like hand-crafted and exclusive -</p>
            <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/mobile1.png" alt="subscription" class="mobile-view-image">
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/desktop1.png" alt="subscription">
            <span class="image-footer">Iteration 1 - Putting the entities into sketch</span>
            <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr2.png" alt="subscription">
            <h4>Iteration 3</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr3d.png" alt="subscription"><br><br>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr3m.png" alt="subscription" class="mobile-view-image"><br>
            <h4>Iteration 4</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr4d1.png" alt="subscription"><br><br>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr4m1.png" alt="subscription" class="mobile-view-image"><br><br>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr4d2.png" alt="subscription"><br><br>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/itr4m2.png" alt="subscription" class="mobile-view-image"><br><br>
            <h4>Final Iteration</h4>
            <p>While working on the final iteration we take cared of each and every tuchpoints</p>
            <p>Showing a expired card was a tricky part as we are letting the reader to go and check out the article page and see what they have missed. Expired card is indicated with some opacity and a expired text.</p>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/final-home.png" alt="subscription"><br><br>
            <img src="../img/project-images/subscription/final-article.png" alt="subscription"><br><br>
            <p>As the article finishes the user can check on the exclusive deals on the same page rather then going back again and again.</p>
            <h4>The Emailer</h4>
            <p>For the subscription we created a hand-crafted emailer for the reader so they will have a speacial mail rather than the normal mails when they subscribe. The Emailer should have a highlight of deals and benifits along with some of the hand picked stories.</p>
