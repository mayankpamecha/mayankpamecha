            <p>On July 2017, we were trying to figure out a way to fetch the basic information from the user(Mainly Email) for the Field ( Collection of sports news ). When a user enters the email they get subscribed for the daily Field(Sports) newsletter. </p>
            <p>I was working in a small team of people which included the Product manager, Developers and designers. I had the full ownership of this product so I do not have to work on a tiny piece of the product I will have full ownership which I feel is the best way to work as you cope up with the challenges that you thought you never will.</p>
            <p>Also the challenge was to make a Email template on which the user will get all the daily news for the Field. For that we used the mailchimp to create a template. The real benifit of the mailchimp template is to have a live preview of the code side by side you code. You don't have to refresh each and every time. Not just that we continuisly send the test mails to check the mailer on different instances and mobile devices to make sure nothing breaks.</p>
