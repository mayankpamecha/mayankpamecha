        <div class="project-body lg-6 md-8 sm-12">
            <p>As far as the post-booking experience goes, the booking confirmation page is one of the key user touch points. The user sees the flight booking confirmation screen after his payment has been processed and flights have been booked.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the things that a user can do after he has completed his booking -</p>
            <h4>Primary gigs (specific to the booking)</h4>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Review his booking/ payment details (Users are too anxious to find out what they’ve been charged/ verify if the transaction went through without any problems) </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Print Tickets</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Select Seats</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Send tickets / PNR Info to his co-travellers</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Share trip details on Twitter/ Facebook etc </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Secondary gigs</h4>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Book airport transfers (Uber/ OLA/ Airport Cabs) through their API </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Explore content on the city he is traveling to (Directing traffic to one of our products- Local) </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Book a hotel </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Book a return trip if the user has only booked one way </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Confirm his/ her Account (we might need to educate the customer about benefits)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Points considered while redesigning this page</h4>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>What is the most critical thing that the user needs to know or do after he’s finished his booking ?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>How do we guide the user to complete all the tasks rather than throwing all of them at once?</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>The whole page is divided into 6 section to deliver the best end-to-end user experience. </p>
            <h4>Section 1 : Ticket confirmation section</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/flight-booking/1.jpg" alt="product-hero">
            <p>This section let the user know that his/her booking has been confirmed. User can check the trip ID which can used in all communication with the travel merchant. For this product the travel merchant is Cleartrip.</p>
            <p>There are 3 main sub-sections (primary goals) -</p>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Select your seat - </b> Allows user to select seat.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Share trip details - </b> Send tickets / PNR Info to his co-travellers</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Tell your friends - </b> Share trip details on Twitter/ Facebook etc.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Section 2 : Trip and Payment</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/flight-booking/2.jpg" alt="product-hero">
            <p>To give a proper feel of a ticket I tried to make a ticket kind of section further divided into 2 sub-sections i.e. trip details and payment section.</p>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p><b>Trip Details - </b> The left section of the ticket that contains all the basic information about the flight. There is a Get ticket button which allows the user to print his/her ticket directly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Payment Details/Receipt - </b> The right section contains a full payment receipt, the users can find out what they’ve been charged/ verify if the transaction was a success. The user can also check out the taxes and fees breakdown by clicking on the breakdown hyperlink which will open a modal window showing the full payment and fares breakdown.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Section 3 : Book cabs, Hotels and explore locals</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/flight-booking/3.jpg" alt="product-hero">
            <p>In this section the user check about the primary thing about the place he is travelling.</p>
            <p>What a user actually wants to know when he lands to a whole new place ? Place to live, what’s trending, and how to reach there.</p>
            <h4>Section 4 : Book return trip</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/flight-booking/4.jpg" alt="product-hero">
            <p>The aim was to show the best flight fares for a week to the user so that he can check the best fares. It's rough and need some more design changes.</p>
            <h4>Section 5 : Explore your account</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/flight-booking/5.jpg" alt="product-hero">
            <p>This entire block is to educate user about his/her account on how they can create their profile, Get personalised offers in the profile section, Check their trips, Adding the trips to the online and offline calendars, cancel a part or the entire trip and some other useful tools.</p>
            <h4>Section 6 : Feedback</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/flight-booking/6.jpg" alt="product-hero">
            <p>If we missed out something or there is some room for improvent is the booking experience the user can share in this section. It helps getting the user feedback and help improve the experience</p>
