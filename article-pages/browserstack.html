                <h3>Design explorations</h3>
                <p>Started by conducting quick research on Browserstack Screenshots. The Goal was to find a pattern of highlighting the length and breadth of the OS and browser versions offered by BrowserStack.</p>
                <p>In the design iterations, I tried to cover up the following points - </p>
                <ul class="list-style-disc">
                    <li>
                        <p>Allowing the user to select all the versions of a browser for a specific OS.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Letting the user select the length and breadth of OS and Browser versions.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Iteration 1 (Desktop view)</h4>
                <p>Used a toggle view with a set of secondary search options like - OS selection, Browser selection, and resolution selection.</p>
                <p>All the 3 secondary search options will open in the tooltip format containing the options of the user to select.</p>
                <p>The user can cancel all his selections in the secondary search followed by a segment.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/browser/web1.png" alt="web1">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>For the solution, I have used only 2 OS and the browsers associated with them. The data used here is for design purpose only. I can maybe incorrect with the browser and resolution numbers.</p>
                <p>There is a slight change in the search input. I have moved the recent out of the input along with the capture button. Just a slight design change as I feel confused where the generate or capture button is.</p>
                <p>The toggle helps to switch from desktops to mobile devices and vice versa.</p>
                <p>In the browser versions, I am not completely showing all the versions by showing the user only the latest ones. Most of the users will be there to check their product on the latest and some of the second preferred versions. In case a user wants to see all the versions he can tap on the More link which will appear all the versions.</p>
                <p>To select all the version of a browser on a specific OS. User can simply tap on select all to simply select all the versions at once.</p>
                <p>When the user taps on generate screenshots button or capture button he will be redirected to the Browserstack Screenshots results page. Nothing changed here.</p>
                <p>The setting link below the generate screenshots button acts as a panel. A small panel will come up for further advanced options.</p>
                <h4>Iteration 1 (Web Full view)</h4>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/browser/web-full-view.png" alt="web full"><br><br>
            <img src="../img/project-images/browser/web-full-selected.png" alt="selected">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>These screens show the behavior when the user taps on the more link and while clicking on the select all.</p>
                <h4>Iteration 1 (Mobile toggle view)</h4>
                <p>Users can easily select the mobile or web with the help of the toggle. The toggled view helps to separate the web segments from the mobile for easy access.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/browser/mobile1.png" alt="mobile">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <h4>Iteration 2 (Using custom filters)</h4>
                <p>Another way to round up things is to use a filter for the OS, Browser, and Resolution.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/browser/filter.png" alt="filter">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <h4>Iteration 2 (Filter's Open)</h4>
                <p>When you click on the filter icon all the existing options appear here instead of spreading or aligning them throughout the page.</p>
                <p>Filters help it easy to select browser, OS and their respective resolutions.</p>
                <p>You can easily access filters and manage your segments.</p>
                <p><b>Segments here are the entities that you are selecting from the filters or the secondary searches from the iteration 1.</b></p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/project-images/browser/filter-open.png" alt="filter">
            <div class="lg-6 md-8 sm-12 mauto">
                <p>There are many more ways you can use to tackle up the problem. For the assignment, I have used only 2</p>
                <p>Hope you like it. Thanks for reading.</p>
