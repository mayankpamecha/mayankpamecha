            <h3>Problem Statement (Assignment):</h3>
            <p>A group of farmers have started a not-for-profit initiative to sell their produces to the consumers directly using the e-commerce platform.

            <p>Your designs & solution should reflect minimalism and intuitiveness in terms of its usability.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p class="blockquote">Freshin - Freshness Inside is a nonprofit farmer online supermarket app which acts as a mediator between the farmers who are selling their products to customers directly, Thus lets you order fresh perishable food online with just one tap. It offers you the luxury of enjoying fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy products, juices and much more by delivering them to your doorstep. With this app, you can perform a variety of tasks including placing an order, draft an order, modify an order and delete an order.</p>
            <h4>Idea behind freshin</h4>
            <p>My idea of freshness here is being able to consume fresh food with the luxury of having it home delivered</p>
            <h4>Logo</h4>
            <img src="../img/project-images/freshin/1.png" alt="freshin">
            <span class="image-footer">Logo with tagline</span>
            <p>Freshin logo design was really a tricky part for the branding as I have to design something that completely describes the personality of the product while keeping the simplicity in mind.</p>
            <p>For the logo design I have used a Hindi-English fusion font(Prakrta).</p>
            <h4>Tagline</h4>
            <p>I have thought of 2 headlines for freshin that describes or gives a shorthand on what it's about -</p>
            <ul class="list-style-disc">
                <li>
                    <p>Farmer's online fresh supermarket app</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Get it fresh or get it free</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Used the first tagline for this project as it's simple and describes well about the app.</p>
            <h4>Flow</h4>
            <p>A rough flow of the app. For the login and signup I have used a technology of OTP to the registered mobile number. Why not the password ? Password are old fashioned I feel, we need something quick and secure. But I was wrong at that point of time there must be a password too..</p>
